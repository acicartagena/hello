> Every rule has its exception, every principle has its limit

**"It depends"**   
One thing to remember throughout this post (and maybe in your software development career) is that most of the time, the answer is "It depends" because depending on the context, the background, and the reason why, the principle or rule is not applicable, or it would result in a red flag when done too much or too little.

# Pragmatic Programmer
I first read this book from the advice of my mentor. For this, I used the 20th anniversary (2nd edition) published on 2019. The examples in the book may have aged, however I think the tips and the lessons can be considered timeless. This book was written by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. I'd chosen to share 10 tips I found very useful in my day to day. 

## 1. Provide options, don't make excuses üôÄ
- It is us up to us to provide solutions or alternatives, instead of making excuses like the cat üôÄ ate my source code
- Explain what can be done to salvage the situation
- Don't be afraid to to ask or admit we need help

> When you find yourself saying, ‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù be sure to follow it up with ‚Äú‚Äîbut I'll find out.‚Äù¬†

## 2. Don't live with broken windows ü™ü
- Broken windows ü™ü instills a sense of abandonement, that the owners of the building don't care
- Don‚Äôt leave ‚Äúbroken windows‚Äù (bad designs, wrong decision or poor code) unrepaired
  -  Broken windows doesn't need to get replaced, at the very least board it up or let others know about it and come up with a plan of action. This may be letting the team know about the broken window, or leaving a JIRA ticket or a comment on the PR
- Also, don't cause damage just because there's a crisis of some sort üë©‚Äçüöíüî•
  - Remember the story of a very pristine, immaculate and clean house that caught on fire. The firefighters, with their expertise determined there's enough time to remove their boots so as not to dirty the house while fighting the fire. 
  - Aim to have a very clean, pristine codebase that no one wanted to be the first one to mess it up

## 3. Remember the big picture üê∏ü´ïüî•
- Constantly review what‚Äôs happening around you 
  - Not just what you‚Äôre doing
- Don‚Äôt be like the Boiling Frog üê∏ü´ïüî•
  - ‚ÄúThey‚Äù say that if you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, then gradually heat it, the frog won't notice the slow increase in temperature and will stay put until cooked.  
  - Science says ^ the above story is not true. But this makes it easier to remember tip 3

## 4. Good enough software
- Does **NOT** imply sloppy, hacky or poorly written code
- Users would rather use software with rough edges TODAY than wait months for shiny version
- Know when to stop
  - Don‚Äôt spoil a good enough code with OVERREFINEMENT
  - Move on, and let your code stand on its own right for a while

## 5. Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio üìàüìö
- The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change.
- Don‚Äôt put all your technical eggs in one basket
- Ideas / Suggestions:
  - Read technical & non technical books
  - Stay current - Read news and posts online on technology different from that of your current project
  - Learn a new language
  - Experiment with different environments

## 6. Critically analyse what you read and hear
- Get closer to the root cause
  - Ask the 5Ô∏è‚É£ Whys
![Why](/images/posts/pragmatic-why.gif){: width="300" height="150" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
- What‚Äôs the context?
  - Everything occurs in its own context
  - ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù solutions usually don't because it depends on the context
- When there's an article or book touting a ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù
  - Best for who?
  - What are the prerequisites?
  - What are the consequences, short and long term?
- Why is this a problem?
  -  Is there an underlying model?

> A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.
  
## 7. It‚Äôs both what you say and the way you say it
- Know your audience
  - Understand the needs, interests & capabilities of your audience
  - gather feedback. Don't just wait for questions: ask for them
  - Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.
- Choose your moment
  - Make what you're saying relevant in time, as well as in content. 
  - ‚ÄúIs this a good time to talk about...?'‚Äô or "Do you have the headspace to talk about..."
- Be a Listener
  - Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words
- Get Back to People
  - In the rush of everyday life, it's easy to forget
  - Always respond to emails and ~voicemails~ slack, even if it's "I'll get back to you"

## 8. There are no final decisions
- The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stone and in not preparing for the contingencies that might arise
![Pivot](/images/posts/pragmatic-pivot.gif){: width="300" height="150" style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto"}
- Flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment, and vendor integration.
- What you can do is make it easy to change
  - Hide third-party APIs behind your own abstraction layers. 
  - Break your code into components: even if you end up deploying them on a single massive server

### Reversibility
- There is always more than one way to implement something, and there is usually more than one vendor available to provide a third-party product.

> No one writes perfect software, so it's a given that debugging will take up a major portion of your day.

### Debugging Mindset
- You need to turn off many of the defenses you use each day to protect your ego, tune out any project pressures you may be under, and get yourself comfortable.
- Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.
- When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data.
- Are there any other places in the code that may be susceptible to this same bug?
  - Make sure that¬†whatever happened, you'll know if it happens again. 
- if the bug is the result of someone's wrong assumption, discuss the problem with the whole team

## 9a. Failing test before fixing code
- The best way to start fixing bug is to make it reproducible.
  - if you can't reproduce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed?
- isolate the circumstances that display the bug
  - you'll even gain an insight on how to fix it.  

## 9b. Don't Assume it - prove it
- Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug because you ‚Äúknow‚Äù it works.
- Prove it in¬†this¬†context, with¬†this¬†data, with¬†these¬†boundary conditions

## 9c. Read the error message
- In our panic, stress we might gloss over the error message. 

## 10. Avoid Fortune-Telling
- Don‚Äôt outrun your headlights 
  - We can't see too far ahead into the future, and the further off-axis you look, the darker it gets
- Design for future maintenance? Yes, but only to a point: only as far ahead as you can see.
- You might find yourself slipping into fortune telling when you have to
  - Estimate completion dates months in the future
  - Plan a design for future maintenance or extendability
  - Guess user's future needs
- The more you have to predict what the future will look like, the more risk you incur that you'll be wrong.
- Instead of wasting effort designing for an uncertain future, you can always fall back on designing your code to be replaceable.
- Much of the time, tomorrow looks a lot like today. But don't count on it
