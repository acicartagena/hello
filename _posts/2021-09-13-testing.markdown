TLDR:
- this blog has different goals:
    - improve my technical writing skills
    - share coding thoughts & ideas
    - keep track and something to look back on for reference
- feedback is welcome! (always be improving)
- i'm going to treat posts as living documents and will update as I go / learn more

//actual post to follow :)
