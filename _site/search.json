      "content"  : "  Every rule has its exception, every principle has its limit“It depends” One thing to remember throughout this post (and maybe in your software development career) is that most of the time, the answer is “It depends” because depending on the context, the background, and the reason why, the principle or rule is not applicable, or it would result in a red flag when done too much or too little.A Philosophy of Software DesignJohn Ousterhout writes the book. I used the 2nd edition, published in 2019. This book provides guidelines and principles for creating high-quality, maintainable, and scalable software systems. The book also emphasizes the importance of simplicity, abstraction, and strategic design to minimize complexity and improve software development.ComplexityComplexity is anything related to the structure of the system that makes it hard to understand and hard to modifySymptoms of ComplexityOne of the things that I really liked from this book is how it defines symptoms of complexity. I sometimes struggled with putting into words the gut feel i have and this somehow helps.Change AmplificationChange amplification is when simple change requires code modification in multiple places. The goal of a software design is to reduce the amount of code affected by design decision, and that design changes don’t need too many code changes. for example: before refactoring colors to be more semantic, when designers said to change the shade of blue, we had to go thru and find that shade of blue everywhere in the codeCognitive LoadCognitive load is how much a developer needs to know to complete a task. Can the system be structured so that callers of that piece of code don’t have to worry.for example: api with too many methods, global variables, dependencies between modules sometimes an approach with more lines of code is actually simpler, because it reduces cognitive loadUnknown UnknownsIt’s not obvious which pieces of code must be modified to complete a task. Something a developer needs to know and there’s no way to find out and the only way to be certain is to read every line. Another goal of a system is to be obvious. A developer can make a quick guess about what to do and be confidentCauses of ComplexityDependency - A piece of code can not be understood or modified in isolation. Dependency leads to Change Amplification and Cognitive Load. (Like meetings, I don’t think we can fully not have any dependency on a complex system. The goal is to minimize dependencies, make it simple and obvious)Obscurity - Important information is not obvious. One big culprit is inconsistency. Obscurity leads to Cognitive Load and Unknown Unknowns.The next sections are more to do with ideas / quotes on how to minimise complexity  “Working Code isn’t Enough”Tactical Programming ❌  Get something working  May be a bit short-sighted  Planning for the future isn’t a priorityStrategic Programming ✅  Invest time to improve the design of the system  Proactive investment  Try a couple of alternative designs(It doesn’t have to be one or the other, I’m a believer of also trying to get things to work first, which is tactical programming, then look into ways to make it better, which is strategic programming)  “Modules should be deep”Modules  Relatively independent software. Can be divided into Interface and Implementation (Functionality) For example: Functions, Classes, Subsystems or SercicesInterface  Describes what a module does and not how it does it  Cost of using a module (What a developer needs to know)Deep Abstraction ✅ vs Shallow Abstraction ❌Deep Abstraction ✅  More details abstracted from the Interface, the better  Benefit of the module is its functionality  Cost of the module is it’s functionalityShallow Abstraction ❌  relatively complex interface in comparison to the functionality it provides  the benefit they provide (not having to learn how they work internally) is negated by the cost of learning &amp; using their interfaces  example: Pass Through Module ❌          method offers no abstraction, since all of its functionality is visible through its interface        private void addNullValueForAttribute(String attribute) {  data.put(attribute, null);}                    Combine vs Split methods  Splitting methods introduces complexity          More components the harder it is to track and find      Additional interfaces to consider      Creating separation means the components may be farther apart                  End up flipping back and forth to understand how they work                      example: Conjoined Methods ❌          physically separated methods, but they can only be understood by looking at the other      ideally, methods should be understood independently        “Design it Twice!”  Provide multiple options for major design decisions. Modules or components that have wide impact in the system or codebase  Compare alternative designs. Consider the following factors:          Radically different approaches      Compare weaknesses vs features of designs      Does one alternative have a simpler interface?      Does one interface have a more efficient implementation?        “Code should be Obvious”  Obvious code should allow a developer to read it quickly without much thought          and the first guesses and assumptions about the behaviour are right        2 factors to consider to help making code obvious:          Consistency                  Similar things done in similar ways          Reader recognise patterns                          Can draw safe conclusions without analysing the details                                          Obvious names                  names that are meaningful, provide clarity and reduce the need for documentation                      “Software design is never done. Experience shows better ways to do thingsPragmatic ProgrammerI first read this book from the advice of my mentor. For this, I used the 20th anniversary (2nd edition) published on 2019. The examples in the book may have aged, however I think the tips and the lessons can be considered timeless. This book was written by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt. I’d chosen to share 10 tips I found very useful in my day to day.1. Provide options, don’t make excuses 🙀  It is us up to us to provide solutions or alternatives, instead of making excuses like the cat 🙀 ate my source code  Explain what can be done to salvage the situation  Don’t be afraid to to ask or admit we need help  When you find yourself saying, “I don’t know,” be sure to follow it up with “—but I’ll find out.” 2. Don’t live with broken windows 🪟  Broken windows 🪟 instills a sense of abandonement, that the owners of the building don’t care  Don’t leave “broken windows” (bad designs, wrong decision or poor code) unrepaired          Broken windows doesn’t need to get replaced, at the very least board it up or let others know about it and come up with a plan of action. This may be letting the team know about the broken window, or leaving a JIRA ticket or a comment on the PR        Also, don’t cause damage just because there’s a crisis of some sort 👩‍🚒🔥          Remember the story of a very pristine, immaculate and clean house that caught on fire. The firefighters, with their expertise determined there’s enough time to remove their boots so as not to dirty the house while fighting the fire.      Aim to have a very clean, pristine codebase that no one wanted to be the first one to mess it up      3. Remember the big picture 🐸🫕🔥  Constantly review what’s happening around you          Not just what you’re doing        Don’t be like the Boiling Frog 🐸🫕🔥          “They” say that if you take a frog and drop it into boiling water, it will jump straight back out again. However, if you place the frog in a pan of cold water, then gradually heat it, the frog won’t notice the slow increase in temperature and will stay put until cooked.      Science says ^ the above story is not true. But this makes it easier to remember tip 3      4. Good enough software  Does NOT imply sloppy, hacky or poorly written code  Users would rather use software with rough edges TODAY than wait months for shiny version  Know when to stop          Don’t spoil a good enough code with OVERREFINEMENT      Move on, and let your code stand on its own right for a while      5. Invest regularly in your knowledge portfolio 📈📚  The more technologies you are comfortable with, the better you will be able to adjust to change.  Don’t put all your technical eggs in one basket  Ideas / Suggestions:          Read technical &amp; non technical books      Stay current - Read news and posts online on technology different from that of your current project      Learn a new language      Experiment with different environments      6. Critically analyse what you read and hear  Get closer to the root cause          Ask the 5️⃣ Whys        What’s the context?          Everything occurs in its own context      “one size fits all” solutions usually don’t because it depends on the context        When there’s an article or book touting a “best practice”          Best for who?      What are the prerequisites?      What are the consequences, short and long term?        Why is this a problem?          Is there an underlying model?        A good idea is an orphan without effective communication.7. It’s both what you say and the way you say it  Know your audience          Understand the needs, interests &amp; capabilities of your audience      gather feedback. Don’t just wait for questions: ask for them      Continuously improve your knowledge of your audience as you communicate.        Choose your moment          Make what you’re saying relevant in time, as well as in content.      “Is this a good time to talk about…?’’ or “Do you have the headspace to talk about…”        Be a Listener          Encourage people to talk by asking questions, or ask them to restate the discussion in their own words        Get Back to People          In the rush of everyday life, it’s easy to forget      Always respond to emails and ~voicemails~ slack, even if it’s “I’ll get back to you”      8. There are no final decisions  The mistake lies in assuming that any decision is cast in stone and in not preparing for the contingencies that might arise  Flexibility in the areas of architecture, deployment, and vendor integration.  What you can do is make it easy to change          Hide third-party APIs behind your own abstraction layers.      Break your code into components: even if you end up deploying them on a single massive server      Reversibility  There is always more than one way to implement something, and there is usually more than one vendor available to provide a third-party product.  No one writes perfect software, so it’s a given that debugging will take up a major portion of your day.Debugging Mindset  You need to turn off many of the defenses you use each day to protect your ego, tune out any project pressures you may be under, and get yourself comfortable.  Always try to discover the root cause of a problem, not just this particular appearance of it.  When trying to solve any problem, you need to gather all the relevant data.  Are there any other places in the code that may be susceptible to this same bug?          Make sure that whatever happened, you’ll know if it happens again.        if the bug is the result of someone’s wrong assumption, discuss the problem with the whole team9a. Failing test before fixing code  The best way to start fixing bug is to make it reproducible.          if you can’t reproduce it, how will you know if it is ever fixed?        isolate the circumstances that display the bug          you’ll even gain an insight on how to fix it.      9b. Don’t Assume it - prove it  Don’t gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug because you “know” it works.  Prove it in this context, with this data, with these boundary conditions9c. Read the error message  In our panic, stress we might gloss over the error message.10. Avoid Fortune-Telling  Don’t outrun your headlights          We can’t see too far ahead into the future, and the further off-axis you look, the darker it gets        Design for future maintenance? Yes, but only to a point: only as far ahead as you can see.  You might find yourself slipping into fortune telling when you have to          Estimate completion dates months in the future      Plan a design for future maintenance or extendability      Guess user’s future needs        The more you have to predict what the future will look like, the more risk you incur that you’ll be wrong.  Instead of wasting effort designing for an uncertain future, you can always fall back on designing your code to be replaceable.  Much of the time, tomorrow looks a lot like today. But don’t count on itPresentation"

      "content"  : "When reviewing code, I used to think it had to be something I 100% agree with.  I thought I was doing right, making sure any code that gets merged is as good as it can be. Looking back, acting as a custodian of the codebase, I was walking the line between that and gatekeeping. Back then, I was all about code consistency and maintainability, and I thought frustrating code review experiences were a trade-off to ensure a consistent codebase. Don’t get me wrong. Code consistency and maintainability are essential. But focusing too much on the current way we’re doing things, we might miss out on improving things for the better.“Not the best choice” versus fundamental flaws feedbackNew ideas or new ways of doing things are introduced in a code base and communicated via code review. Regardless of whether or not this is a good way to introduce changes (especially when working as a team), it happens often as we all aim to make code better. When trying to find the balance between maintaining consistency using existing patterns vs. exploring new ideas, I go back to this line from this article: Is this change something I can live with?  Is this change something I can live with?“Not the best choice” versus fundamental flaws feedback helps me figure out how much value I put in the changes I want to be done. Not the best choice means I can think of a better solution, but what’s currently there is acceptable. The fundamental flaws feedback is where the current solution is unacceptable and being able to mention why concretely. There will always be different ways to solve one problem. The critical thing to keep in mind is that the solution doesn’t always have to be how I thought.Compassionate Code Review CommentsWhen it comes to actual code review comments, this presentation on compassionate code reviews is my go-to for more practical tips. It talks about three filters to use to check.  Is it True?          if it’s a fact (mention the source/additional documentation),  if it’s opinion or a preference (say so explicitly), try a question and avoid “shoulds” or “right/wrong” language        Is it Necessary?          be aware of nitpicks, and check does it have to be addressed by this pull request        Is it Kind?          assume competence and seek to understand and remember you’re dealing with a human with emotions      One of the more valuable tips is trying a question instead of telling the author what to do. A question can come in many forms. I initially took this advice and added, “can you do/change ___ ?”. I was still telling the author what I wanted to be achieved and masked it with a question. And so sometimes I try to ask “what do you think of __ ?”. This way we can have a discussion first, maybe they’ve thought about it tried it out and it didn’t work or maybe this suggestion has inspired them and we can work on the solution together.Over time, instead of making the author change their code, I moved to ask why the code was that way. From the answer I get, I could get more context as to their thinking and the requirement. Getting more context by asking why first has helped me weigh whether the changes I want to be done fit the problem being solved.As part of dealing with humans with emotions, I’d also try to look for positive things or things I found to be good and make sure to let the author know by giving praise or a thumbs-up emoji. It might be considered noise by other people, but positive and negative feedback will help ensure good practices are communicated and maintained.Give more contextAfter figuring out what sort of code changes I think can make the code better, I try and sort out the reasoning why. When asking someone to change their current approach (something that works and is probably tested), I find it helps the suggestion whenever I give more context. The reasoning can give insight into my thought process and double-check my assumptions with my code review comment. If my goal is to teach a pattern or a principle, providing the reason also makes it easier for them to remember and adapt in the future.Lastly, after explaining why, I also try and think if a code snippet or an example would help lessen misunderstanding. It provides something concrete that can be easily discussed. Sometimes describing changes or pseudocode can lead to assumptions being made and more back and forth if those assumptions aren’t aligned. I also hope it shows that I (as a reviewer) have also made an effort to figure out if my suggestion would work with the current code being reviewed.It might seem a lot of work to do all these when talking about code. (It’s something that I try to be mindful of, and I don’t always get it done) However, code reviews aren’t like coding (where we’re communicating with a computer, and it’s primarily black or white or right or wrong). Code reviews communicate with a human (with emotions and ego) and deal with shades of gray. The outcome or the code changes might be the same, but the experience or how you get there with the discussion will be different. Over time, a collection of less frustrating code reviews is better for the people working on the same codebase.What I Read (or Watched)  Compassionate Yet Candid Code Reviews by April Wensel          25 minute video on the 3 filters to ask for compassionate code reviews        How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human (Part Two          Provides a familiar example of a bad code review      Offers up tips like bringing code up by a letter grade (from C to B), respect the scope of the review        Babylon Health Etiquette on Code reviews          Has good bullet points for everyone, for code reviewers and code authors        Code Review Guidelines for Humans by Philipp Hauer          Bit of a longer read, but it does provide good explanations for the different points made.

      "content"  : "TLDR:  my goals for this blog:          keep track and share coding thoughts, ideas and learnings      improve technical writing skills        posts would be shitty first (and second) drafts that will be improved/iterated on  feedback is encouraged (email: hello@aci.codes)Blog goalsI like coding/programming/software development/software engineering (I’m not sure what you want to call it). I think I’m good at it, and I can always do better by learning. I have some thoughts on software development. And probably have written some of them down somewhere (Twitter or a company’s confluence page). The goal of this blog is to have a space for me to keep track of those thoughts/ ideas/learnings/references. Writing things down also helps me remember them more. This blog is mainly for me to remember what I learned and maybe something to look back on from time to time.As a software developer, my day-to-day isn’t just about coding. One big part of software development is communicating, not just with the computer but with people too. Similar to what I think to most developers, I do struggle with it. I find it hard dealing with the blank page and starting a document. Maybe by practicing writing my thoughts down, I would be more comfortable and less likely to procrastinate documentation. And maybe with more practice (and hopefully feedback from other people), I can improve my technical writing skills.Shitty first draftI struggle with looking at a blank page and not knowing how to start things. In the same way, I want to create good quality code. I expect a certain level of quality in my posts. But, I do know I can’t be great at the start, especially with blogging. And so, the way I will approach this is with the idea of a shitty first draft. Similar to coding, where we iterate on code and make it better as we know more. The shitty first draft will be the foundation of this blog. The posts I would write (including this one) will probably be not that great at the start (and it’s ok), and I can continue working on and improving them.  The shitty first draft will be the foundation of this blog. The posts I would write (including this one) will probably be not that great at the start (and it’s ok), and I can continue working on and improving them.Blog tech stackThis blog is generated using Jekyll and is stored in this repository.  I like that writing posts would have the same workflow as coding, where I can continue to update/improve blog posts as commits. The underlying architecture of the blog (having it hosted in git) has ease of iteration/improvement as one of its main features. Using git also allows to keep a history of the post, and diffs can be available of the past revisions.(I don’t know much about web development, and so if there are issues in the blog feel free to reach out and let me know)(I also forgot what I used to host and so I’m typing this here as a note for future angela to check Netlify)FeedbackDuring my student days, English (especially grammar) was my worst subject.   I tend to ramble a lot in writing and have trouble with rules on tenses and punctuation. When it comes to code, there’s the compiler that tells me whenever I broke some of them. When it comes to writing, I would probably read them and have a sense of whether it feels right or not. (Probably not the best way) English language aside, there’s also a lot of room for improvement in technical writing. Have I achieved my goal of communicating my ideas in a way that’s easily understood?In saying that, it would be great and a massive favor if I can get some feedback on my posts. I’m still trying to figure out if I want a comment section. So, for now, feel free to email me at: hello@aci.codes or send me a message on Twitter.I don’t know how to end this post (this can be your first point of feedback) and so see you later on my next post, I guess :)"
